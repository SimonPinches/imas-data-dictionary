Generation of the Data Dictionary HTML documentation

1) Generate the full dictionary IDSDef.xml file by applying xsd2IDSDef_global_AbolutePath.xsl on DD_TOP.xsd
2) Generate the HTML documentation by applying IDSDef_global2htm.xsl on IDSDef.xml

It would be good to set up the makefile to do this on demand - JBL
