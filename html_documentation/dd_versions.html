				<td>DD version</td>
				<td>List of changes w.r.t. previous version</td>
			</thead>
<tr>
				<td>3.3.0</td>
				<td>Harmonization of the core_*, distributions and distribution_sources IDSs with the edge_* IDSs: separation of ion and neutral species into 2 similar structures, utilisation of generic structure for vector components applied to electric field and velocity</td>
			</tr>


<tr>
				<td>3.2.3</td>
				<td>Addition of the iron_core IDS. Addition of a wall outline structure in the wall IDS. Correction of errors in the ece IDS.</td>
			</tr>
<tr>
				<td>3.2.2</td>
				<td>Technical bugfix on distribution_sources and distributions IDSs.</td>
			</tr>
<tr>
				<td>3.2.1</td>
				<td>Addition of new IDSs: edge_sources, edge_transport, distribution_sources, distributions, ece. Addition of a ggd structure in the equilibrium IDS. Changes in the wall and transport_solver_numerics IDSs</td>
			</tr>
<tr>
				<td>3.2.0</td>
				<td>Addition of a few nodes in the following IDS: core_profiles, core_sources, transport_solver_numerics, equilibrium, wall, nbi</td>
			</tr>

<tr>
				<td>3.1.0</td>
				<td>Addition of IDSs (edge_profiles, transport_solver_numerics, wall), revision of the core_* IDSs to have the same structure as the edge_profiles IDS. A few IDSs moved to the active status: core_profiles, core_transport, core_sources, equilibrium</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>3.0.4</td>
				<td>Addition of several new IDSs (antennas, charge_exchange, core_instant_changes, dataset_description, interfero_polarimeter, mhd_linear, nbi, ntms, pellets, sawteeth, thomson_scattering)</td>
			</tr>
			
									<tr>
				<td>3.0.3</td>
				<td>Utilities: Strings in the "code" structure change type, from 1D to 0D (time-dependent strings are not yet supported)</td>
			</tr>

						<tr>
				<td>3.0.2</td>
				<td>Core*_ IDSs: corrected the usage of plural for array of structures (rule R1.8): ions -> ion, charge_states -> charge_state; multiple_charge_state_flag -> multiple_charge_states_flag</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>3.0.1</td>
				<td>
				<table>
				<tr><td>Equilibrium IDS: time_slice(:)/global_quantities/b_tor_axis moved to time_slice(:)/global_quantities/magnetic_axis/b_tor</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Lifecycle version information updated to new convention (dots only, no underscore) in all IDSs</td></tr>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3.0.0</td>
				<td>Initial release of DD major version 3, implementing arrays of structure indexed on time</td>
