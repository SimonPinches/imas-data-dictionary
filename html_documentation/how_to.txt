Generation of the Data Dictionary HTML documentation

1) Generate the full dictionary IDSDef.xml file by applying xsd_2_IDSDef.xsl on dd_physics_data_model.xsd
2) Generate the HTML documentation by applying IDSDef_2_HTMLDocumentation.xsl on IDSDef.xml

It would be good to set up the makefile to do this on demand
